# 🌈✨ **Process Control Block (PCB)** 🧩💻

_“Where every process keeps its secret diary~” 💕_

---

## 🌟 **1. Definition — The Heart of Every Process**

Every process in an operating system has a **special data structure** that stores everything the OS needs to manage it.
This structure is called the **Process Control Block (PCB)** — or sometimes, the _Task Control Block (TCB)_.

💡 Think of the PCB as a **magical profile card** for each process — containing its identity, memories, and powers!

🪄 Without it, the OS wouldn’t know:
– Which process is running 🏃‍♀️
– What it was doing last ⏳
– Or even where its code lives 🗺️

## 🧭 **2. Components of the PCB (aka: What’s Inside the Spellbook~)** 📜

Each PCB keeps track of many details about a process.
Let’s peek inside carefully, shall we~? 💖

---

### 🔹 **Process ID (PID)**

A unique number that identifies the process — like your student ID in the OS Academy 🎓✨

---

### 🔹 **Process State**

Shows the **current status** of the process:
🟢 _Running_ | 🟡 _Ready_ | 🔵 _Waiting_ | ⚫ _Terminated_

💬 _tips:_ “Think of it as mood tracking for processes~” 😌

---

### 🔹 **Program Counter (PC)**

Points to the **next instruction** the process will execute —
like a bookmark in your favorite light novel 📖✨

---

### 🔹 **CPU Registers**

Store temporary data, calculations, and addresses the CPU is working with.
They’re like the process’s _short-term memory_, super quick and vital! ⚙️

---

### 🔹 **Memory Management Information**

Includes memory limits, segment tables, or page tables.
Basically, it defines _where in memory the process lives_ 🏰

---

### 🔹 **List of Open Files**

Keeps track of files the process is currently using —
like its collection of magical scrolls and data tomes 📚🪶

---

### 🔹 **I/O Status Information**

Shows which input/output devices the process is using
(e.g., printers 🖨️, disks 💽, or magical portals 🌀).

---

### 🔹 **CPU Scheduling Information**

Contains priority level, process queue pointers, and scheduling parameters —
this helps the OS decide _who gets to run next_ in the grand tournament~ ⚔️🏁

---

### 🔹 **Accounting Information**

Records how much CPU time ⏰ or memory 💾 the process has used.
Perfect for audits, resource management, or just bragging rights~ 😏✨

---

## 🌷 **3. How the PCB Works (Behind the Magic Curtain~)**

When a process is created, the OS creates its PCB.
When it pauses, switches, or ends — all updates go right back into this record! 🗂️

💫 **Context Switching Magic:**
When switching between processes, the OS saves the _current process’s PCB_
and loads the _next one’s PCB_.
👉 This allows seamless switching — like flipping between characters in an RPG without losing progress~ 🎮💖

# 🖥️ **Operating System Interface – Command Interpreter**

---

## 🔹 **What is a Command Interpreter?**

A **Command Interpreter** is a software component that allows users to interact with the operating system using commands. It processes commands **entered by the user** and executes system functions accordingly.

📌 **Key Purpose:**

- ✔️ Acts as a **bridge** between the user and OS.
- ✔️ Interprets and executes **command-line instructions**.

## 🔹 **Command Interpreter in Different OS**

🛠️ **Operating Systems handle command interpreters differently:**

- **🔹 Some OSs include the command interpreter inside the kernel.**  
  Example: Embedded systems, older OS versions.

- **🔹 Others (like Windows & UNIX) treat it as a separate program.**
  - Runs as a **user-level process** outside the kernel.
  - Can be customized or replaced by different shells.

## 🔹 **What are Shells? 🐚**

In systems with multiple **command interpreters**, they are called **shells**. Users can choose different shells based on preferences and features.

### 🔹 **Examples of Popular Shells**

💻 **UNIX/Linux Shells:**

- **Bourne Shell (sh) 🏛️** – The original UNIX shell.
- **C Shell (csh) 📜** – C-like syntax, scripting features.
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell) 🐧** – Most popular, powerful, and widely used in Linux.
- **Korn Shell (ksh) ⚙️** – Combines features of Bourne & C shell.
- **Z Shell (zsh) 🚀** – Advanced, highly customizable shell with auto-completion & themes.

💻 **Windows Shells:**

- **Command Prompt (cmd) 🖥️** – Basic CLI in Windows.
- **PowerShell 🔷** – Advanced scripting and automation tool.

### 💡 **Fun Fact:**

🔹 The term **"shell"** comes from the idea that it is an **outer layer** that interacts with the OS kernel! 🏗️
